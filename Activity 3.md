# **Activity 3: Implementing Your Knowledge**

## **Objective**

Apply what you've learned from the previous activities to design a **Travel Diary** webpage. We'll guide you through the steps, providing hints on what to use. It's your chance to demonstrate your understanding of both HTML structure and CSS styling.

## **Prerequisites**

- Completion of Activities 1 and 2.
- Familiarity with the basics of semantic HTML and CSS properties introduced.

## **Materials**

- A code editor.
- A web browser for preview.
- Image assets (Use images from royalty-free sites or personal collections).

## **Steps**

### 1. **Setup**

- Create a new folder named `TravelDiary`.
- Inside this folder, create two files: `diary.html` and `diary.css`.

### 2. **HTML Structure**

We've started the HTML structure for you. Your task is to complete it based on the instructions:

In `diary.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Travel Diary</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="diary.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>My Travel Diary</h1>
        <!-- Hint: Consider adding a navigation just like in Activity 2 -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <article>
            <!-- Hint: Each article entry should have a title, date, image, and content. -->
        </article>
        <!-- Hint: Add two more article entries below. -->
    </main>
    <!-- Hint: Remember how to close your webpage with a nice footer. -->
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. **CSS Styling**

Now, in `diary.css`, we won't provide the exact code. Instead, we'll give hints based on what you've learned:

- Set the body's font family to something readable. Remember how we did it in the previous activities.
- Give the header a nice background color and centralize the text.
- Design your navigation. Make it horizontal and ensure links change appearance when hovered over.
- Style the article entries. Give some padding and margin to space things out.
- Images within articles can be set to a specific width for uniformity.
- Don't forget to style the footer. Maybe give it a contrast from the main content?

### 4. **Preview, Debug & Refine**

- Open `diary.html` in a web browser.
- Check if your Travel Diary looks and feels right. If something seems off, refer back to the hints and see if you missed anything.
- Remember, it's okay to make mistakes. Debugging is a significant part of coding!

## **Extensions**

1. Add a sidebar with links to popular travel destinations.
2. Experiment with different background colors or even gradients.
3. Consider adding hover effects for article entries.
